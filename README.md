# Modular Monolith E-Commerce Application

## Overview

**ECommerceApp** is a modular monolith built with **.NET 8** that serves as an example of how to build an e-commerce system using a modular architecture. The application is structured into three primary modules:

- **Orders**: Manages customer orders and interacts with the product catalog to create orders.
- **Products**: Handles the product catalog, exposing product information.
- **Customers**: Manages customer information.

### Key Features

- **Modular Monolith Architecture**: The application is divided into modules (Orders, Products, Customers) with loose coupling.
- **Dependency Injection**: The modules interact using shared interfaces for decoupled communication.
- **Shared Contracts**: Contracts are placed in a separate project to avoid circular dependencies between modules.
- **Logging**: Integrated logging using **ILogger**.
- **Swagger UI**: API documentation and testing via **Swagger**.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular monolith structure, where each module is self-contained but part of a single application.

## Requirements

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or any other C# IDE
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server) or other databases (optional, based on your implementation)

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ECommerceApp.git
   cd ECommerceApp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Run the following command to restore all required packages:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Build the project**:

   Build the project using the following command:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

4. **Run the application**:

   Start the application:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

5. **Access the API**:

   Once the app is running, you can access the API at:

   ```bash
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

6. **Swagger Documentation**:

   Visit the Swagger UI for API documentation:

   ```bash
   http://localhost:5000/swagger
   ```

## Usage

### Orders Module

The Orders module allows for creating, retrieving, and managing customer orders. It depends on the **Products** module for product data.

Key Endpoints:

- `POST /orders`: Create a new order
- `GET /orders`: Get all orders
- `GET /orders/{id}`: Get order by ID

### Products Module

The Products module manages the product catalog and exposes product data to other modules via a shared interface.

Key Endpoints:

- `GET /products`: Get all products
- `GET /products/{id}`: Get product by ID

### Customers Module

The Customers module handles customer data and services.

Key Endpoints:

- `GET /customers`: Get all customers
- `GET /customers/{id}`: Get customer by ID

## Logging

Logging is integrated using `ILogger`. Example of usage:

```csharp
public async Task CreateOrderAsync(Guid customerId, List<OrderItem> items)
{
    _logger.LogInformation("Creating order for customer {CustomerId}", customerId);
    // business logic here
    _logger.LogInformation("Order created for customer {CustomerId}", customerId);
}
```

Logs are written to the console, and you can extend this to use other logging providers (e.g., file logging, cloud logging).

## Swagger Integration

Swagger is integrated to allow easy API documentation and testing. To access Swagger, go to:

```bash
http://localhost:5000/swagger
```

You can interact with all the API endpoints directly from the Swagger UI.
